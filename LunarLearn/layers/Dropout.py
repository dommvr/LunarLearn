class Dropout(BaseLayer):
    """
    Dropout layer with autograd support.

    Randomly drops activations during training with probability 
    (1 - keep_prob) and rescales the remaining values. This helps 
    prevent overfitting. In inference mode, dropout is bypassed.

    Args:
        keep_prob (float, optional):
            Probability of keeping a unit active (0 < keep_prob < 1).
            Default is 0.8.

    Attributes:
        keep_prob (float):
            Probability of retaining each activation.
        inv_keep_prob (float):
            Scaling factor applied during training (1 / keep_prob).
        output_shape (tuple):
            Same as input shape, set during initialization.

    Methods:
        initialize(input_shape):
            Sets the output shape to match the input shape.
        forward(A_prev: Tensor) -> Tensor:
            Applies dropout during training, or passes input unchanged
            during inference.
