class Flatten(BaseLayer):
    """
    Flatten layer that reshapes input from (N, C, H, W) into (N, C*H*W).

    This layer is typically used to bridge convolutional layers with fully
    connected (Dense) layers. Reshaping is tracked by autograd so gradients
    flow correctly without a custom backward implementation.

    Attributes:
        nodes (int): 
            Total number of features per sample after flattening.
        output_shape (tuple): 
            Shape of the output tensor after flattening, excluding the batch dim.

    Methods:
        initialize(input_shape):
            Lazily initializes the layer based on input shape (C, H, W).
        forward(A_prev: Tensor) -> Tensor:
            Flattens the input tensor to 2D (batch, features) and returns it.

        Perform the forward pass: flatten input to 2D.
